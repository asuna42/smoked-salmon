Changelog for version 0.9.3.5 (2025-04-24):

Big update from Audionut! The coolest part: you can now send torrents straight to qBittorrent using its API. No more messing with watched folders or adding them by hand.

Check `config.py.txt` for the new `QBITTORRENT_XXX` settings. With that option, if youâ€™re using Docker, you might not need to map the `.torrents` folder anymore, just use `/app/.torrents` inside the container: torrents will be generated there and injected into qbittorrent. Additional configuration, specific to docker, might be necessary to be able to call the `qbittorrent` API from smoked-salmon container.

## What's Changed
* Add qBitTorrent support by @Audionut in https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/62
* Add async input compatibility for Windows by @redusys in https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/63

## Metadata Parsing Improvements

Numerous small changes were made to improve metadata parsing accuracy.  
If you encounter any strange metadata behavior, please share feedback â€” and if possible, include metadata links so we can reproduce the issue.

## What's Changed
- Update wiki installation link in `README.md` by [@digeratimt](https://github.com/digeratimt) ([#23](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/23))
- Update `oxipng` install command in `README.md` by [@digeratimt](https://github.com/digeratimt) ([#25](https://github.com/smokin-salmon/smoked-salmon/pull/25))
- Release is now marked as 24bit if **any** file is 24bit (previously only the first file was checked)
- Improved Qobuz artist parsing (better detection of guest artists)
- More accurate Album/EP/Single classification:
  - Less than 3 tracks â†’ **Single**
  - Less than 5 tracks â†’ **EP**
  - 6 tracks with no release type â†’ **EP**
  - Otherwise uses metadata release type, or defaults to **Album**
- Deezer API responses now use English (mainly affects genres)
- If a source is specified for a WEB release, it takes top priority for metadata
- Removed usage of Qobuz ID as catalog number (CatNo)
- Improved regex detection of "Self-released" label
- Added `NO_GENRES_FROM_QOBUZ` option:
  - Prevents fetching localized genres from Qobuz
  - Useful for non-English accounts
  - Default: `false`

## New dependency
Oxipng is a modern replacement for OptiPNG, written in Rust and optimized for multi-core processors. It offers faster processing and better compression than OptiPNG. Smoked-salmon now utilizes Oxipng for PNG compression, achieving around a 30% reduction in file size, making it more efficient for image hosting.

You'll need to install Oxipng on your system (it's already included in the Docker image). Installation instructions can be found on the official repository: https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng.

Ubuntu/Debian users can simply run the following command (make sure to check the latest Oxipng release first, and replace the link accordingly):
```
wget https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng/releases/download/v9.1.4/oxipng_9.1.4-1_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i oxipng_9.1.4-1_amd64.deb
```
Alternatively, you can still disable compression by setting `COMPRESS_SPECTRALS = False` in your `config.py` file.

## What's Changed
* Replace `optipng` by `oxipng`
* Use `process_files` (better multithreaded processing) for spectrals generation
* Fix broken log upload for CDs (broken during ruff fixes)
